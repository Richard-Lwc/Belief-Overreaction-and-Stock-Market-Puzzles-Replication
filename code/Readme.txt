1. Aggregate level and firm level data analysis.R: for calculating all aggregate level as well as firm level statistics, e.g., LTG, forecast errors, including FF5 grouping and returns.
2. Cumulative return and FF5 ranking calculation.ipynb: for calculating 1-year, 3-year and 5-year cumulative return of aggregate, firm and decile portfolios as well as FF5 ranking.
3. LTG_portfolio_data_to_dta.do: for transforming "LTG_portfolio_return.csv" generated by Python to "LTG_portfolio_return.dta" for later Stata processing.
4. market level.do: for replicating Table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8 based on aggregate level data, also adding cumulative return of different time-period for robustness checks. 
5. firm_level.do: for replicating Table 6 based on firm level data.
6. Table9_FF5.do: for replicating Table 9, testing the predictability of factor returns and forecast errors with LTG and its lag.

Note: 1) Stata do files use csvs in datasets from Data and those from WRDS to generate the exact tables (in DOC format) in the paper.
